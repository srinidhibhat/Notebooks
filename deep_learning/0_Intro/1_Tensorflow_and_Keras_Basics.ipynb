    "In 2017, Google's TensorFlow team decided to support Keras in TensorFlow's core library. Keras was conceived to be an interface rather than a standalone machine learning framework. It offers a higher-level, more intuitive set of abstractions that make it easy to develop deep learning models regardless of the computational backend used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code.  \n",

    "In addition to standard neural networks, Keras has support for convolutional and recurrent neural networks. It supports other common utility layers like dropout, batch normalization, and pooling.  \n",
